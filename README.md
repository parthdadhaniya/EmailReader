# EmailReader

Fetching Unread Emails:
Connect to an email account (such as Gmail) using Python.
Retrieve all unread emails from the inbox.
Extracting Email Details:
For each unread email:
Extract relevant details such as the sender’s email address and the email subject.
Save these details in a structured format (e.g., a database or a model).
Keyword Search in Email Body:
Search for predefined keywords within the body of each email.
If a keyword is found, perform a specific action (e.g., validation success).
To achieve this, you can follow these steps:

Email Retrieval:
Use the imaplib library to connect to the email server (e.g., Gmail’s IMAP server).
Authenticate using your email credentials.
Select the inbox folder.
Fetch the list of unread email IDs.
Parsing Email Content:
Iterate through the list of unread email IDs.
For each email ID:
Fetch the email content using mail.fetch(i, '(RFC822)').
Parse the email content to extract relevant information (sender, subject, body).
Saving Email Details:
Store the extracted details (sender, subject) in a suitable data structure (e.g., a Python dictionary or a database table).
Keyword Search:
Within the email body, search for predefined keywords.
If a keyword is found, trigger the desired action (e.g., validation success).

Integrating Celery:
Install and configure Celery in your project.
Define a Celery task that encapsulates the email retrieval and parsing logic.
Set up a periodic task using Celery’s scheduling feature:
Run the task every 15 minutes to check for new unread emails.
If any unread emails are found, process them as described above.

Benefits of Using Celery:
Asynchronous Processing: Celery allows tasks to run independently, improving overall system responsiveness.
Task Scheduling: Celery’s built-in scheduler ensures regular execution of tasks.
Scalability: Easily scale your application by adding more workers to handle concurrent tasks
